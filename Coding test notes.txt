This one creates a bunch of empty results before finally showing the real thing, and it still looks messed up:

Link 1 works.  It prints a bunch of times, but that's because its supposed to do so for every item on the "pre-results"
array.  So the blank "results" must be what the try-catch thing were there to prevent.

SO WHAT I NEED (in order):
-only scrape board books
-A better way for getting dimensions and weight (no idea how to do this)
-A way to get image
-Try/catch safeguards. (get the working)

Or no, first I have to get it all to go into one array.  I was creating a bunch of reuslts arrays before.  But moving
around the console.log statement and the variable declartion has had bizarre results.

Let's try to follow the logic of my program as its written:


Declare preresults as an empty array.
For each "a", get the title, link, and image attribute.
Then if it doesn't have an undefined title and undefined image, create a variable called productLink
and an array called results...
WAIT A MINUTE...this it the problem isn't it?  results[] is created everytime it finds an 
item in pre-results with a title and image.
But placing it above the for loop, or even at the top of the program, doesn't help (although if it just above the for loop
it doesn't seem to hurt either).

So let's start again.
Declare an empty pre-results array.
Request the amazon book page.
Get each (a) and save their link, image, and title (IT WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER TO ONLY SAVE THEM IF THEY HAVE DEFINED
IMAGES AND TITLES HERE, SO MOVE THE IF STATEMENT?)

Okay, bracket 111 deleted. If statement moved.  Let's see the results.

Same problem!  WTF!

So let's start again.
Declare an empty pre-results array.
Request the amazon book page.
Get each (a) and save their link, image, and title.  Push those to an array only if the image and title are not undefined.
So now we've created the preresults array.
So with that done we create an array called results.  To avoid redundancy, we start at 1 and go up by two in the for loop.
Each time we create a product link variable using the preresults item. (OT NOTE: I NOTICE I'M MISSING THE TRY/CATCH
STATEMENT FOR THE FIRST HMTL, BUT IIRC WHEN I HATE THAT THE PROGRAM STOPPED RUNNING.  ANYWAY, BACK ON TOPIC...)
Then, using the product link to send request, we do the following only if the html is true:
We gather information from the page and store it in variables.  Then we push it into an array called results.
Now, in this version, we console log for every push, and THAT IS PROBLEMATIC.  We should console log only when the 
results array is full.  BUT DOING THIS JUST CAUSES IT TO KEEP RETURNING WITH NOTHING.  

Put the first try/catch back, but same old problem. WTF!!!




Okay, there are 9 opening brackets.  Now how many closing?

10?

Okay, I've got it to function.  But now it just doesn't start.  Why?

What!?  All of the sudden preresults stopped working.  Ugh WTF!

Okay, let's break down how we want this to work again:

First, there's a function called firstScraper.  It calls the url and does everything.  So it needs to be defined,
and then called.  So since it does everything, firsScraper() should be at the very end, which it is.

So firstScraper gets initialized, and what does it do?
It goes into the requested url, and if that doesn't work, it starts over, hence the "if (html)" statement.
If it can make it to the requested url, it cans each "a" tag and stores there stuff in an array.

Once it's gone through all the "a"s, it starts to loop through the preresults.  For each result, it does the secondScraper
function.

Okay, let's make another version.  

So bizarre, all that work and I'm back to square 1 :/ Same problem
